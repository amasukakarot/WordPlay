# WordPlay
Simple implementation of Word Association Game which can be played currently in the terminal.


## What is Word Association?
* Word Association is a common word game involving an exchange of words that are associated together. The game is based on the noun phrase word association, meaning "stimulation of an associative pattern by a word" or "the connection and production of other words in response to a given word, done spontaneously as a game, creative technique, or in a psychiatric evaluation. <br/>
